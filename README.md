## NBody-CSC250-project1
N-Body Simulation for CSC250 (Data Structures) project 1 at TCNJ.

## Motivation
This project was to create a program simulating the motion of N objects in a plane, accounting for the gravitational forces mutually affecting each object as demonstrated by Issac Newtonâ€™s Law of Gravitation.  Ultimately, creating a program 'NBody.java' that draws an animation of bodies floating around in space pulling on eachother with graviational forces.

## Tests
Inside the 'test/' subdirectory, there are a suite of tests that can be used to ensure the simulation will excecute sucessfully.

## How to use?
Once complied, run 'java NBody < <data/data_file>' in a unix command line to run the NBody simulation.
